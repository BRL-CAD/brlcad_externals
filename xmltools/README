This is a stripped down subset of the libxml2/libxslt libraries, with the sole
purpose of building xsltproc and xmllint to support Docbook building.

Really should see if the more modern vanilla builds can do what we need now.
IIRC one of the concerns was turning off enough pieces to avoid any unnecessary
dependencies - we only need the basic core of the functionality here...
