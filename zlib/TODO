REALLY need to test out https://github.com/zlib-ng/zlib-ng and see if
its ZLIB_SYMBOL_PREFIX feature could make using our own "custom" zlib
easier...  A lot of the reason we are patching zlib has to do with
assigning a prefix so we can avoid conflicting with system zlibs getting
pulled in by dependencies
