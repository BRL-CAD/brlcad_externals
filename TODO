Rather than having to link both extinstall and extnoinstall into home for
automatic detection in the parent build, maybe have it look for a single
brlcad_ext directory that contains both... should be a minor adjustment of the
target directories in both builds.  A "make install" target to copy everything
to $HOME might be in order as well... probably should also correct the paths
if we do that so the copy will work in-place, even though that's not the normal
expected use case...

Update custom rules in parent BRL-CAD build to suppress warnings/messages by default

Figure out what makes sense from a CI perspective...  parent build will have to
clone and build the minimum (which will be pretty much everything on Windows and
OSX) - will it make sense to also CI test this repository separately?
