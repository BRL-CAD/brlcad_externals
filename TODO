Update custom rules in parent BRL-CAD build to suppress warnings/messages by default

Figure out what makes sense from a CI perspective...  parent build will have to
clone and build the minimum (which will be pretty much everything on Windows and
OSX) - will it make sense to also CI test this repository separately?
