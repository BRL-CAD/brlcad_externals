Improve BRL-CAD parent build's copying logic - should be fairly straightforward
using the newer CMake features to only erase, copy and re-process files that have
been added/removed/changed and leave already successfully staged files alone...

Need to add a extnoinstall file that is touched via custom target every time
this repository is built, so the parent CMake build will have something to
trigger on for re-configure even if all the updated build does otherwise is
add new files - right now, only adding files isn't something that will trigger
a re-configure in the parent build.

Need to prepare a replacement for the BRL-CAD parent build's doc/legal/other
setup where ext licenses are concerned - Qt has a bunch and warrants a subdirectory,
and ideally for the others we'll have a rule grabbing the license directly out
of the source repo and staging it somewhere in extinstall/doc/legal/...

Rather than having to link both extinstall and extnoinstall into home for
automatic detection in the parent build, maybe have it look for a single
brlcad_ext directory that contains both... should be a minor adjustment of the
target directories in both builds.  A "make install" target to copy everything
to $HOME might be in order as well... probably should also correct the paths
if we do that so the copy will work in-place, even though that's not the normal
expected use case...

Use LIEF to make a patchelf command line compatible replacement executable:

Update custom rules in parent BRL-CAD build to suppress warnings/messages by default

Figure out what makes sense from a CI perspective...  parent build will have to
clone and build the minimum (which will be pretty much everything on Windows and
OSX) - will it make sense to also CI test this repository separately?
